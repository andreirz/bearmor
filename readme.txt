== Description ==

**Finally, a WordPress security plugin that doesn't slow down your site.**

Bearmor Security is built for **small to medium businesses, freelancers, and agencies** who need real protection without the bloat. No confusing dashboards, no technical jargon, no performance hit.

### Why Bearmor?

You shouldn't need a security degree to protect your website. Bearmor gives you clear, actionable insights in plain English.

**⚡ Lightweight & Fast**
Unlike bloated competitors, Bearmor won't slow down your site. Clean code, efficient scans, zero impact on performance.

**💰 Most Features FREE**
While others lock everything behind paywalls, Bearmor gives you professional-grade security for free. Compare us to Wordfence, Sucuri, or iThemes Security - we're more generous.

**🛡️ Real Protection, Not Theater**
We focus on what actually matters: detecting threats, blocking attacks, and keeping you informed. No fake "critical alerts" to scare you into upgrading.
